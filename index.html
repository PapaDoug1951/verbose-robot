    <p>I wrote and ran my first program as a college student in 1970.  I have worked 
      professionally as a programmer for over 35 years since that time (with a few 
      detours into two other careers).  For the last 30 of those years, I've been 
      working for companies as an AS/400 (iSeries, System i, etc.) programmer.  I was
      recently RIFed when my position was eliminated, and having found that I've 
      enjoyed working from home during the Covid-19 pandemic, decided a change is in order.
